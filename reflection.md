Reflection: 

I had no previous experience using github or any of the softwares we were using for this assighment so it was tricky at first. The assighment was not hard just setting everything up was the difficult. I am still not sure how to push files from gitbash to github using the command line. Another mistake we made at first was not adding numpy as np to jupiter so we couldnt get the code to work. 
The pair programming was helpful because it was nice having someone check for mistakes and helping to correct them while your doing your assighment.
